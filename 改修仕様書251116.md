[JAPANESE WATERCOLOR MINIMAL - v2.2 (Hair Tone Locked, No Kimono)]
Subject / Motif: adult Japanese woman holding a bouquet of flowers gently in her arms 

A delicate Japanese watercolor illustration on textured washi paper.
Hand-drawn pencil line (very thin, slightly uneven), airy grain.
Face and hands highly refined; clothing and background simplified as soft abstract washes.
Low-mid saturation, high-key whites, generous negative space.

ATTIRE POLICY (modern only):
- Contemporary everyday wear ONLY (tank top, T-shirt, blouse, knit, light sportswear, simple dress).
- Absolutely NO traditional garments or elements: no kimono, no yukata, no hakama, no furisode, no obi sash,
  no kimono collars, no wide kimono sleeves, no traditional patterns (e.g., seigaiha, asanoha).

HAIR TONE LOCK (prevent whitening):
- Hair color: deep cool black-brown (NOT gray/white/blonde).
- Base wash: #1F242A-#2B2F36, mid-glaze: #343A42-#404650, warm depth hint with sepia/indigo mix.
- Highlights only as thin reflective strands up to #B8C1C8 (no pure white fills).
- At least 90% of the hair area must be tinted (avoid leaving paper white).
- Lashes/eyebrows match hair tone; a few natural flyaway strands.

Pose & framing:
- Waist/bust-up, gentle 3/4 or side profile; elegant posture, natural Japanese proportions.
- If hands appear: Japanese hands, slender and correct anatomy.
- Detail contrast: facial features smooth and precise; clothing & background kept painterly.

Watercolor technique:
- Wet-on-wet + glazing; feathered edges, controlled bloom/backrun effects.
- Paper tooth visible; matte finish; subtle pigment granulation.
- Dry-brush accents at edges; lost-and-found contours at shoulders.

Palette guide:
- Skin: paper white base + faint blush #EFCAD3 on cheeks/lips.
- Hair: deep black-brown as above (cool bias).
- Clothes/washes: diluted cool gray-blue #6E7A87 -> #B8C1C8; optional powder pink #F2DCE6, soft teal-gray #C9D7D2.
- Keep saturation restrained; preserve clean white paper areas.

Lighting & mood:
- Soft ambient window light; gentle rim light on cheek/nose; serene, intimate, contemporary.

Background:
- Plain white or very pale wash; 2-3 broad abstract strokes only (vertical or circular).
- Keep one side brightest for airy text space.
